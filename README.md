#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing testing and mainting software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The birth of software engineering(1968-1970s): the term software engineering was first introduced. this period saw the introduction of structured programming The rise of object-oriented programming (1980s-1990s): the use of languages like C++, java and smalltalk this time improved scalability and software design practices The Agile revolution and DevOps (2000s-Present): this introduced flexible development methodologies, cloud computing, microservices and containerization futher transformed how software is built and deployed

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: defines the project scope, objectives and feasibility identifies risks, costs and resource requirements Requirement analysis: Gathers and documents functional and non functional requirements engages stakeholders to ensure clarity and completeness. Design: create blueprints and system models. Implementation: coding, developers write codes based on the design specifications uses programming languages frameworks and best coding practices Testing: verifies that the software functions as expected. Deployment: Releases the software to production or end users Maintenance and Support: fixes bugs, enhances features and ensures performance, adapts software to changing requirements or environments.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Model- Approach: Sequential and Phase-based; Process: Each phase of software development life cycle is completed before moving to the next; Flexibility: Changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is completed; Customer involvement: Limited customer involvement after initial requirement phase. Delivery time: delivered as a single final product after full development; Testing: happens after development is completed. Example: Medicial system, Government or large enterprise projects, construction or manufacturing software. Agile Model- Approach: Flexible and Iterative; Process: Continuous cycle of planning development testing and review; Flexibility: Changes can be incorporated even late in development; Customer involvement: Frequent collaboraton with stakeholders and customers; Delivery time: Delivers working software in small incremental releases; Testing: Continuous testing throughout the development process. Example: Startups and web application, game development, E-commerce platforms.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: its roles vary based on the projects but generally include; designing, coding, testing, ensuring functional, efficient and scalable applications while continuouslyimproving and adapting to new challenges Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures that software meets quality standards before it is released to users ensuring that software is reliable, functional, secure and user-friendly. the identify bugs, improve software reliability and ensure smooth user experience Project manager is responsible for planning, executing and overseeing software development projects to ensure they are completed on time within scope and within budget. Their leadership, organization and problem solving skills help keep the team focused and productive. They act as a bridge between stakeholders, developers and other teams to ensure smooth collaboration

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Integrated devlopment environments provides tools to streamline the software development process. it reduces errors, and simplifies coding by integrating various features into a single interface. it significantly improve the efficency, accuracy and organization of software development. they help developers write, test and maintain code more effectively. Example: Visual coding studio. Version control System (VCS) helps in managing code changes, track modifications, enabling collaboration among developers, diaster recovery, ensures code integrity and enhance teamwork in software development projects. Example: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenge 1: Changing requiremnt and scope: projects often experience evolving requirements due to shifting business needs or feedbacks which can lead to scope creep and missed deadlines. Strategies: Agile methodologies, clear documentation of requirement baseline and update it as changes are approved, regularly engage with stakeholders to clarify prioritize requirement Challenge 2: Balancing quality and speed: pressure to deliver features quickly can compromise code quality, leading to bugs and future rework. Strategies: test driven development, continuous integration/deployment, incremental releases.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing is a software testing method where indiviual components or units of source codes are tested in isolation from the rest application it helps developers catch defects early, encourage good design practices and maintain high quality reliable software. it reduces debugging time, improves code quality, facilitates code refactoring and supports continuous integration/depolyment. Integration testing is a type of softwaretesting where indiviuals components are combined and tetsed as a group to verify that they work togther as intended. integration examines the interaction between components, ensuring data flows correctly and that interfaces between components are compatible. it helps in early detection of interface issue, ensure system cohesion, reduce risk of failure production, improves maintainability, support continuous integration System testing ensures that the complete application works as inteneded in its entirety. it focucses on both functional and non-functional aspects in a realistic environment, system testing ensures that all components integrate properly, that useer requirements are met and that any system wide issues are identified and resolved before the product reaches the end user. Acceptance testing is a final phase of software quality assurance that ensures the product meets the defined business user requirements before going live. By invloving end users in the testing process and stimulating real-world conditions, it not only validates the software functionality and usability but also minimizes the risk of post deployment issues, ultimately contributing to a more reliable, user friendly and successful product.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Promtpt engineering is the practice of desigining and optimizing prompts to effectively interact with artificial intelligence (AI) models such as ChatGPT, Gemini to achieve desired output. it involves crafting clear, structured and contextually relevant input to guide the AI in generating accurate, useful and meaningful responses. It enhances productivity by reducing ambiguity, refining results and mimnimizes biases. Effective prompt engineering enbales users to extratct meaningful insights, automatic tasks and imptove decision making. In fields like content creation, coding and research, it maximizes AI's efficiency. By refinning prompts iteratively, users can fine tune AI responses, making AI tool more accessible and valuable across industries. Mastering prompts engineering is key to leveraging AI's full potential

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. Example of a vague prompt: Explain Science Improved Prompt: Provide a brieft overview od Physics including its main branches and real-world applications. The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clarity, specificity and direction ensuring the AI generates a relevant and structured
